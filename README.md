Description-

This website is solely devoted to the art of learning any skill, we all know learning any new skill can be little monotonous if done alone. Even we came across this problem and 
so we thought of developing a website which would connect people from all over the globe who want to learn the same/similar skill, where they can chat, teach, learn all
in one platform. 


Features-

1. Chatroom- A group of people aiming to learn the same skill can either join or create a chatroom and can complete their tasks given in the "Timeline" section.
2. They can upload the video of their task as a proof, and as a help for their peers.
3. Can share their journey and experience by writing blogs in the Blog section.
4. Earn a badge each time you learn a new skill!
